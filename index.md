I am currently a PhD student in Department of Finance of Guanghua School of Management. Before joining GSM, I had acquired both my bachelor and master degrees in Lingnan College, Sun Yat-sen University under the supervision of [Prof. Xianbo ZHOU](https://lingnan.sysu.edu.cn/faculty/ZhouXianbo). I also went to [Warwick Business School](https://www.wbs.ac.uk/), [The University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/) as an exchange student in 2019.
