## Basic Profile
### Professional Background 
Firstly, I am good at math. I won the first prize in the 10th National College Students Mathematics Competition
in 2018 (the only person in Lingnan College) and during the undergraduate period, I have been a member of the
International Mathematics Program of Lingnan College. So besides compulsory math courses (Advanced Mathematics
(99/100), Linear Algebra (100/100)), I also took several hard math courses such as Differential Equations (94/100),
Real Analysis (92/100), Stochastic Process (95/100), Game theory and Operations Research. Secondly, I am adept
at English. I got 7.5 in IELTS (listening 8.5, reading 8.5), and in the fall of 2019, I went to Warwick Business School
at the University of Warwick to study as an exchange student, so I am able to communicate with people fluently in
English. Thirdly, I am proficient in programming software like Stata, R, MATLAB, Python, typesetting software such
as LaTeX and Markdown and bibliometrics software like VOSviewer, CiteSpace. I use these software to finish many
research papers.
