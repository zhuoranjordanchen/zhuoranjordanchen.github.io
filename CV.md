## Basic Profile
### Professional Background 
Firstly, I am good at math. I won the first prize in the 10th National College Students Mathematics Competition
in 2018 (the only person in Lingnan College) and during the undergraduate period, I have been a member of the
International Mathematics Program of Lingnan College. So besides compulsory math courses (Advanced Mathematics
(99/100), Linear Algebra (100/100)), I also took several hard math courses such as Differential Equations (94/100),
Real Analysis (92/100), Stochastic Process (95/100), Game theory and Operations Research. Secondly, I am adept
at English. I got 7.5 in IELTS (listening 8.5, reading 8.5), and in the fall of 2019, I went to Warwick Business School
at the University of Warwick to study as an exchange student, so I am able to communicate with people fluently in
English. Thirdly, I am proficient in programming software like Stata, R, MATLAB, Python, typesetting software such
as LaTeX and Markdown and bibliometrics software like VOSviewer, CiteSpace. I use these software to finish many
research papers.

### Research Experience
I have engaged in the research projects of many professors at Lingnan College
since I was an undergraduate student.

In 2021, I participated in the National Social Science Fund Major Project “Research on the Basic Role of Consumption
Enhancement on Economic Development” (21ZDA036) led by [Professor Xianbo ZHOU](https://lingnan.sysu.edu.cn/faculty/ZhouXianbo) (Master’s Supervisor) of Lingnan College. I also helped Professor Yan ZENG write the
2019-2021 Natural Science Foundation Summary Report and draw up review reports many times pointing out unique insights to the shortcomings of these manuscripts. Moreover, I conducted research on the optimal subsidy mechanism from the perspective of consumption chain and supply chain under the supervision of Professor Yan ZENG.

In 2020, I participated in the research of [Professor Zihui YANG](https://aif.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/117) of Advanced Institute of Finance, Sun Yat-sen University in terms of systemic financial risk, and under
the supervision of Professor YANG, I deeply studied the relationship between financial crisis and financial network
stability from the perspective of risk contagion in the financial system.

In 2019, I involved in the research project of “Text Analysis and the Application of Machine Learning Methods in
Economics and Finance” led by [Professor Jianhao LIN](https://lingnan.sysu.edu.cn/faculty/LinJianhao) of Lingnan College. I used LDA and Louvain algorithms to
conduct text analysis on monetary policy reports, and extracted policy uncertainties in central bank communication.

I also helped [Professor Rui LU](https://bus.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/LuRui) of School of Business, Sun Yat-sen University in applying for the National Social Science Fund Major Project
“Research on the Prevention and Resolution of Major Risks in the Capital Market under the New Situation” and used
bibliometrics to conduct network clustering analysis of systematically important literature.
