## Basic Profile
### Professional Skills
1. **Math**: I won the first prize in the **10th National College Students Mathematics Competition** in 2018 (the only person in Lingnan College) and during the undergraduate period, I have engaged in the International Mathematics Program of Lingnan College. So besides compulsory math courses (Advanced Mathematics (99/100), Linear Algebra (100/100)), I also took several hard math courses such as Differential Equations (94/100), Real Analysis (92/100), Stochastic Process (95/100), Game theory and Operations Research. 

2. **English**: I got 7.5 in IELTS (listening 8.5, reading 8.5), and in the fall of 2019, I went to Warwick Business School at the University of Warwick to study as an exchange student, so I am able to communicate with people fluently in English. 

3. **Programming**: I am familiar with programming software like Stata, R, MATLAB, Python, typesetting software such as LaTeX and Markdown, and bibliometrics software like VOSviewer,CiteSpace. I used these software to finish several research papers.

### Research Experience
I have involved in the research projects of many professors at Lingnan College
since I was an undergraduate student.

1. In 2021, I participated in the National Social Science Fund Major Project “Research on the Basic Role of Consumption Enhancement on Economic Development” (21ZDA036) led by [Professor Xianbo ZHOU](https://lingnan.sysu.edu.cn/faculty/ZhouXianbo) (Master’s Supervisor) of Lingnan College, delving into the relationship between technological progress in urban sector and demands for rural products.

2. In 2020, I participated in the research of [Professor Zihui YANG](https://aif.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/117) of Advanced Institute of Finance, Sun Yat-sen University in terms of systemic financial risk, and under the supervision of Professor YANG, I deeply studied the relationship between financial crisis and financial network stability from the perspective of risk contagion in the financial system.

3. In 2019, I engaged in the research project of “Text Analysis and the Application of Machine Learning Methods in Economics and Finance” led by [Professor Jianhao LIN](https://lingnan.sysu.edu.cn/faculty/LinJianhao) of Lingnan College. I used LDA and Louvain algorithms to conduct text analysis on monetary policy reports, and extracted policy uncertainties in central bank communication.

4. I also helped [Professor Rui LU](https://bus.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/LuRui) of School of Business, Sun Yat-sen University in applying for the National Social Science Fund Major Project “Research on the Prevention and Resolution of Major Risks in the Capital Market under the New Situation” and used bibliometrics to conduct network clustering analysis of systematically important literature.
