## Summary of My Research
Regarding my participation in research projects, on the one hand, I have finished four working papers, one of which has been submitted. My first paper fixates on technological progress and consumption. I divide the impact of technological progress on differences between the urban and rural consumption of China into two channels: the price effect affected by the substitution elasticity and the common prosperity effect influenced by the minimum consumption. I find that the relative increase in the technological progress of the urban sector, compared with that of the rural sector, restrains the increase in the proportion of consumption in China’s rural sector through the price effect and the common prosperity effect. My findings help to explain why the proportion of rural consumption in China has declined over the past 40 years, but the rate of decline gradually slowed down. This paper further analyzes the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of these two effects using Mean Observation OLS method and delves into the mechanism behind these two effects through stochastic frontier analysis.

My second paper focuses on how an exogenous uncertainty shock influences domestic and foreign consumption under different consumer confidence regimes. By specifying a threshold vector autoregression model with the consumer confidence as the regime variable, I find that low consumer confidence will exacerbate consumption both at home and from abroad, but it will benefit the export, compared to high consumer confidence. I then use the forecast variance decomposition to confirm the difference of exogenous shock in the interpretation of the change of endogenous variables under different CCI regimes. Finally, I conduct an international comparison by comparing Chinese results with US results using identical methods and find consumer confidence is much more influential in the US than China.

My third paper is about how the World Health Organization (WHO) could effectively warn the world. This example was first raised by Alizamir et al (2020) who formulated the problem as a dynamic Bayesian persuasion game. In this model I consider an agency (WHO) who privately receives early information about recurring harmful events and issues warnings to induce an uninformed stakeholder (governments) to take preemptive actions. The agency’s decision to issue a warning depends on its reputation, i.e., the stakeholder’s belief in the accuracy of the agency’s information, and the agency faces a trade-off between eliciting a proper response today and maintaining its reputation to elicit responses to future events. I find that the agency sometimes strategically misrepresents its advanced information about a current threat to cultivate its future reputation: the agency downplays the risks when its reputation is low and exaggerates the threat when its reputation is high.

My fourth paper is built on Acemoglu et al (2015) and concerned with the financial crisis and financial network stability. I attempt to find the origin of the financial crisis by modeling a financial network composed of several banks, and studying the nature of such a financial network in various situations. I find that the degree of financial risk contagion strongly depends on the structure of the financial network: if the magnitude of the negative shock is lower than a certain threshold, the closer financial network will show greater stability; however, when the negative shock exceeds the threshold, the dense financial network structure will become a fertile ground for brewing financial turmoil.

Besides these official research papers, I also published a lot of blogs on the famous econometric platform Lianxh. My publications include local regression distribution estimators, multivariate normal and multivariate t distributions with and without truncation, practical beamer tips, syntax coloring in LaTeX, comparing tidyverse R to Stata, interpreting logit models, frames in Stata, bi-variate maps using Stata, canonical figures in causal inference, estimating equilibrium correction models using ardl of Stata, assessing omitted variable bias when the controls are endogenous, regression sensitivity analysis. These blogs either are based on theoretical econometric papers and concerned with the derivations of those econometric theorems which can show my mathematical foundations and self-motivation in learning new knowledge or involve the practical tips of using software which can demonstrate my proficient programming skills.
